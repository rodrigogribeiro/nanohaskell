NanoHaskell - A prototype type-checker and interpreter for Haskell
===========================================

Description
----------

This is a implementation of a subset of Haskell that supports:

- Multi-parameter type classes without any extension like type families and functional dependencies.
- Optional type classes: closed world overloaded functions can be defined without type classes / instance declarations.
